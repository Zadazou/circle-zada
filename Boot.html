            <P>
                The reading talks about the <b>history</b> of <b>how personal computer and user-computer interface that we have nowadays comes to be.</b> I always think the interface that we are using today is so <i>natural</i> and <i>instinctive</i> but it took so many changes for both the hardware and software to carry them. It is <span>interesting</span> to learn about the itterations of computer, and the changes between <small>user</small> and computer relationships. 
                
                What's your relationship with your computter?

                I feel like my relationship with my computer has changed as I've realized that it's much easier to curb screen time on there compared to my <strong>phone.</strong> You add limits on phones, but they're still to easy to access. Computers are <button>harder</button> to carry around, and it feels more like the internet and social media are a specific place, rather than being with me at all times.
