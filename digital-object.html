        <h1><b>For You Page</b></h1>
            <p> For You Page is the first page users sees on Titok when they open the app. It provides endless scroll of videos that is tailored to the users' taste by traking user actions like "like", "share", "comment", and time spent on each video. </p>
        <h2><b>Visual Structure</b></h2>
            <p> The visual structure of a For You Page is made of the content, like button, comment button, share button, and video title and description. The content takes up the majority of the page, with the three buttons on the right hand side in a column with "like" on the top, "comment" in the middle, and "share" at the bottom. </p>
