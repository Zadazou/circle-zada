        <h1><b>For You Page</b></h1>
            <p>    For You Page is the first page users sees on Tiktok when they open the app. It provides endless scroll of videos that is tailored to the users' taste by tracking user actions like "like", "share", "comment", and time spent on each video. </p>
            <h2><b>Visual Structure</b></h2>
            <p>     A For You Page is made of the video content, author name and profile picture, like button, comment button, save button, share button, video title, video description, and audio tag. The content takes up the majority of the screen, with the four buttons on the right hand side in a column underneath the profile picture of the author. The order of the buttons is "like", "comment", "save" and "share" from top to bottom. On the left bottom corner is the author's username and video publish date. Below those is the video description. Not all videos necessarily have description. In the example below, the space under the author's user name is blank because the author didn't put an description. </p>
