                Industrial design graduate <a href="https://www.florian-schmid.com/"><b>Florian Schmid</b></a> made these stools by folding fabric that's impregnated with cement then drenching it in water. The stools are called Stiching Concrete. They are made of a material called concrete canvas. It consists of cement layered between fabric and a PVC backing. Once soaked it can be manipulated for a few hours before hardening.
