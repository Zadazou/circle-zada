                <a href="https://salon94design.com/artists/thomas-barger#work"><b>Thomas Barger</b></a> is a artist working in Brooklyn New York. He studied architecture and landscape architecture in university.

                The way Thomas Barger entered the furniture world sounds almost apocryphal — while working as a dog walker, he began to collect paper from the recycling bins outside an NYC police station, then would pulp the paper it in his food processor and affix it with resin to used chairs off Craigslist or his own foam creations. The resulting work, though, is as authentic as it gets — puffy chairs and other furnishings, often with cookie-like holes, painted in brights or pastels.
