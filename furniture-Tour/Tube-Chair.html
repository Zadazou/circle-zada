            <p>This metal tube chair is from the series Objects From Interstitial Space by <a href="https://www.lucasmunoz.com/site/index.php"><b>Lucas Mu単os Mu単os</b></a>. He takes materials meant for behind and in between our walls (architectural interstitial spaces) and cross their designed boundaries to make their place in the room. While conserving their personality as engineered objects meant for constructional and installation use, the purposeful arrangement under which they get combined, entitles them with an upgraded visual and functional value. These pieces, bring to light a re-interpretational approach to matter consumption and industrial standardisation, that opens up to a myriad of possible variations sprouting off standard. </p>
